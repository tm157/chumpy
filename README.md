chumpy
======

## Python3 compatible version for Matt Loper's chumpy package. 

Chumpy is a Python-based framework designed to handle the **auto-differentiation** problem,
which is to evaluate an expression and its derivatives with respect to its inputs, by use of the chain rule.

Chumpy is intended to make construction and local
minimization of objectives easier.

Specifically, it provides:

- Easy problem construction by using Numpyâ€™s application interface
- Easy access to derivatives via auto differentiation
- Easy local optimization methods (12 of them: most of which use the derivatives)


Licensing is specified in the attached LICENSE.txt. 

To install 
```python 
pip install -e . 
```

### I have not made any changes to the files, just converted the files to be compatible to python3
